# Convert-decimal-integers
Project that use functions to convert positive integers between 0 - 255 to binary, hexadecimal and octal. Planned to be used in another (bigger) project

To compile and try the program use the makefile:  
Just type `makefile` and after the compile finished `./bin/Convert_dec` + the integer to convert (not really necesary).  
For deleting directories: `makefile Delete`.

Upload the first version. Just one function is implemented.  
Thing to do: implement the other functions, commenting.
